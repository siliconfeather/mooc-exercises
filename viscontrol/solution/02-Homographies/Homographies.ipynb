    "A *pinhole camera* is perhaps the simplest representation of how cameras, including those used on the Duckiebot, produce images of the scene by recording levels of incident light that reflect of objects in the scene and strike the sensor. The *ideal* pinhole camera treats the aperture as being a point, however most cameras couple wider apertures that allow more light to pass through with lenses that focus reflected light. Coupled with models of lens distortion, many cameras used in practice can be modeled as a pihnole camera.\n",

    "The *pinhole camera model* is a mathematical model that describes the projection of a point in a three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional image plane by an *ideal* pinhole camera, according to perspective projection. Consider a three-dimensional Cartesian reference frame with its origin at the camera (optical) center $C$ and the positive $Z$-axis pointing out of the camera. The $Z$-axis is referred to as the *principal axis*. The two-dimensional image plane is perpendicular to principal axis and located at a distance $f$ behind the camera center (i.e., $z=-f$), where the parameter $f$ is the focal length. In order to avoid dealing with inverted images, we can treat the image plane as being in the positive $Z$-direction, again at a distance $f$ from the camera center.\n",
